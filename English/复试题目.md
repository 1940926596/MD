### **6，你的优缺点？**（***What are your strengths and weakness?\***）

First of all, I am calm and restrained. I have strong adaptability and resilience when facing an unfamiliar environment and unexpected events.

Moreover, I will make a plan for myself every week and complete the tasks strictly according to the plan. Once I determine something,no matter what difficulties I confront, I will overcome it.

In addition, I am empathetic and optimistic so that I can get along with others cheerfully and frequently help others. （优）

I think my greatest weakness is my lack of self-confidence. When comparing myself with others, I always focus on my shortcomings and magnify them,Before an examination or a presentation, I constantly fear that I'm not doing well.Even though

I've practiced it over and over again. But I'm trying to correct it. For example, I share more with my buddies how it feels to complete a task, review what I did adequately,and use more rational analysis rather than wallow in anxiety，（缺）

关于我的优点。首先，我非常冷静和内敛。在面对不熟悉的环境和意料

之外的事件时，我有较强的适应能力。另外，我会每周制定计划并且严格完成计划。当我决定做某事，不管遇到多大困难，我都会克服它。除此之外，我还具有同理心并且很乐观，因此我可以与他人愉快相处，并且乐于助人。

我觉得我最大的缺点是缺乏自信。在考试或者演讲之前，我总是担心自己做不好。即使我已经练习了一遍又一遍。但是我现在在努力改正。比如，我会更多地和朋友分享完成一项任务的感受，会回顾在其中做的好的点，运用更多的理性分析，而不是沉浸在焦虑的情绪中。

### **18，你从你的科研经历/竞赛经历中学到了什么?（\*What have you learned from your research experience / competition experience?）\***

Thanks for your question!

I did my first research project in my sophomore year. It was a team project and I had to cooperate with 4 other students. We encountered several problems during the process. At one point, I almost gave up. Thankfully, with my determination and the help from others, I successfully finished the project. I’ve learned two things from this research experience: firstly, never give up, even in the most difficult situation; secondly, seek others’ help when facing obstacles and always be ready to help others when they are in need.

That‘s all,thank you!

我在大二的时候做了我的第一个研究课题。这是一个团队项目，我与其他 4 名同学合作完成。在研究过程中我们遇到了一些问题。有一次，我几乎放弃了，好在我自己下定了决心， 而且有其他同学的帮助，我最终才成功地完成了这个项目。从那次研究经历中，我学到了两件事：第一，即使在最困难的情况下也不要放弃；第二，在遇到困难时寻求他人的帮助，并随时准备在他人需要时帮助他们。
